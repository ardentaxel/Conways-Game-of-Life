# Conway's Game of Life Finite Grid Implemntation

## Overview
This project is a Java-based application that simulates Conway's game of life on a finite grid.

## Features
- **Dynamic Game Grid**: Utilizes `GameGrid.java` for managing the grid layout and `GameCell.java` for individual cell behaviors.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The interface, managed by `GameView.java`, provides a visual representation of the game world, with cells plotted using `GameCellPlotter.java`.
- **User Interaction**: Players can interact with the game using controls represented by `ControlBtn.java` and organized within `ControlView.java`.
- **Customizable Appearance**: The game's look and feel can be customized using the `application.css` file, allowing for personalized styling of the GUI.

## Future Changes
- **Infinite Grid**: In the future I hope to make the grid infinte that way the cellular automata can evolve infinitely as normal.
